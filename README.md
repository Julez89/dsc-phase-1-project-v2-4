After the first phase of Flatiron Data Science program, this is the first project that will conclude Phase 1.


## Project Overview

For this project, I used exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder from Microsoft.

### Business Problem

We were hired by Microsoft who want to start their own movie studio. We were supposed to create insights based on data in order to help them with the set up of their studio.

### The Data

I used data from IMDB, Box Office Mojo, The Numbers, Rotten Tomatoes and TMD.


### Key Insights

* **Microsoft should produce movies from the following three genres: Adventure, Animation or Sci-Fi. 

* **Microsoft should higher one of the best directors with a great return on investment. For Animation this could be Kyle Balda.

* **Microsoft should vary in terms of the runtime minutes depending on which genre they are producing. An animated movie should have a length of around 100 minutes.
